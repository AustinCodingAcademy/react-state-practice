### Intro
This project was built using create-react-app for convinience sake, but it doesn't matter for what we are trying to demonstrate. The concept would still apply if we built the project with the plain javascript approach of just using script tags and no npm. We are trying to learn why the concept of state is necessary when building software.

What happens when you type into the First Name text box? Should that be happening?


### Setup
Fork, clone, npm install, npm start

### TODO
* Fix this issue in ClassInputForm by using react class state. 
* Fix this issue in HooksInputForm using react hooks useState to fix this issue.

### Questions
Which approach is better?
